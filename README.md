This repository contains my iOS app for browsing the arXiv pre-print server.

## FAQs
* **But... why?**
My goal is to get back into reading publications!
Since finishing my PhD, and consequencely losing univeristy library access, I've really been slacking on this front.
Of course, I could just open up arXiv.org in my browser or use the existing iOS apps, or subscribe to the email updates, or the RSS feed, or... you get my point.
I figured this would be a fun challange, and I want to see if I can generate a super short summary of each preprint using ChatGPT.
I also thought it would be a useful exercise since I've never made an iOS app before!
* **How can I use this app too?** Building iOS apps for personal use is free! You can just install Xcode and plop my source code in there and build away. You will need to provide an OpenAI API key to generate the summaries _(not yet available)_, but the app is completely open source. **I only ask that you cite this repository if you use any of my work :)**
